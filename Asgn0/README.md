# Assignment 0

There are three goals for Assignment 0. The first is to get your programming environment set up properly, which will require that you install an Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine on your personal computer. The second is to learn the lab format for CSE 130 by writing a simple program that does the same thing as the Unix cat command. As with all programming assignments, this lab will require that you submit a design document, README file, and lab writeup along with your code in your git. The third goal is to ensure that you’re ready for this class by giving you a straightforward assignment that will act as a “self-test”.
